Navigation Flow:
----------------
1. Start: docs/README.md
2. New users → getting-started/QUICKSTART.md
3. Running pipeline → getting-started/PIPELINE_CLI.md
4. Understanding concepts → guides/ (labeling, validation, leakage)
5. Technical details → reference/ (architecture, features, slippage)
6. Phase specs → phases/ (frozen specifications)
7. Current status → development/STATUS.md
8. Future plans → development/ROADMAP.md

Result:
-------
Documentation reduced from 49 files to 16 essential documents (67% reduction)
Clear navigation hierarchy with single entry point
All critical information preserved and consolidated
Obsolete/redundant content removed
Clean, maintainable structure ready for Phase 2
