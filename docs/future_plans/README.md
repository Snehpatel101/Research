# Future Plans

This directory contains forward-looking documentation and design proposals for upcoming phases of the ML pipeline.

## Phase 2: Multi-Model Training

**Location:** `phase2/`

Complete architecture and implementation guide for Phase 2, which will add dynamic multi-model training capabilities to support many different model families (N-HiTS, TFT, PatchTST, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.).

**Start Here:**
- `phase2/PHASE2_INDEX.md` - Navigation guide
- `phase2/PHASE2_SUMMARY.md` - Executive overview (5-min read)
- `phase2/PHASE2_QUICKSTART.md` - 30-minute getting started

**Complete Documentation (8 files):**
1. **PHASE2_INDEX.md** - Navigation guide for all documents
2. **PHASE2_SUMMARY.md** - Executive overview
3. **PHASE2_QUICKSTART.md** - Hands-on getting started
4. **PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Day-by-day tasks (5 weeks)
5. **PHASE2_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - One-page cheat sheet
6. **PHASE2_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Complete system design with code
7. **PHASE2_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md** - Architecture Q&A
8. **PHASE2_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md** - Visual diagrams

**Status:** Design complete, ready for implementation
**Effort:** ~70 hours (2-3 weeks)
**Timeline:** 5-week implementation roadmap provided

## Future Phases

### Phase 3: Cross-Validation & OOS Predictions
- Time series cross-validation
- Out-of-sample predictions
- Model performance comparison

### Phase 4: Ensemble Meta-Learner
- Stacking ensemble
- Blending strategies
- Meta-model training

### Phase 5: Full Integration & Live Trading
- End-to-end integration testing
- Live trading simulation
- Production deployment
