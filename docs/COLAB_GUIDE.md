# Colab / Jupyter Guide

This repo is designed to be run from notebooks (Colab + local Jupyter) and from the CLI.

## Recommended (Notebook)

- Notebook docs: `docs/notebook/README.md`
- Colab setup: `docs/notebook/COLAB_SETUP.md`
- Notebook entrypoint: `notebooks/ML_Pipeline.ipynb`

## Optional (One-click helper)

- `colab_setup.py` can install core dependencies and print GPU info.
  - It does **not** replace the notebook’s own setup cells; treat it as a convenience helper.
