# Ridge Regression Meta-Learner Configuration
# For use as meta-learner in stacking ensembles
# Linear model with L2 regularization - simple but effective for combining predictions

# Model identification
model:
  name: ridge_meta
  family: meta_learner
  description: Ridge regression meta-learner for stacking ensembles

# Default hyperparameters
defaults:
  # Regularization
  alpha: 1.0                 # L2 regularization strength

  # Model settings
  fit_intercept: true        # Whether to fit the intercept
  solver: lsqr               # lsqr is efficient for large datasets

# Training settings
training:
  random_seed: 42

# Note: Meta-learners receive 2D OOF predictions (n_samples, n_base_models * n_classes)
