  description: Stacking ensemble with OOF predictions and meta-learner

# Default hyperparameters
defaults:
  # Base models (Layer 1)
  base_model_names:
    - xgboost
    - lightgbm
    - random_forest

  # Cross-validation for OOF predictions
  n_folds: 5

  # Meta-learner input
  use_probabilities: true      # Use class probs (3*n_models features) vs predictions (n_models)
  passthrough: false           # Include original features in meta-learner input

# Training settings
training:

# Device settings
device:
  default: auto                # Inherited from base models
