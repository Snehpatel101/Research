# Calibrated Meta-Learner Configuration
# For use as meta-learner in stacking ensembles
# Probability calibration wrapper for well-calibrated prediction probabilities

# Model identification
model:
  name: calibrated_meta
  family: meta_learner
  description: Calibrated classifier meta-learner for stacking ensembles

# Default hyperparameters
defaults:
  # Base estimator
  base_estimator: logistic   # Base classifier to calibrate

  # Calibration settings
  method: isotonic           # Calibration method: isotonic or sigmoid
  cv: 5                      # Cross-validation folds for calibration

# Training settings
training:
  random_seed: 42

# Note: Meta-learners receive 2D OOF predictions (n_samples, n_base_models * n_classes)
