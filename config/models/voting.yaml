# Voting Ensemble Configuration
# Combine predictions from multiple base models
# GPU: Depends on base models

# Model identification
model:
  name: voting
  family: ensemble
  description: Voting ensemble combining predictions via majority vote or averaging

# Default hyperparameters
defaults:
  # Voting strategy
  voting: soft                 # "hard" for majority vote, "soft" for probability averaging

  # Model weights (optional)
  # If null, all models weighted equally
  # If list, weights must match number of base models
  weights: null

  # Base models to train (if training from scratch)
  base_model_names:
    - xgboost
    - lightgbm
    - catboost

  # Per-model config overrides
  base_model_configs: {}

# Training settings
training:
  feature_set: boosting_optimal
  random_seed: 42

# Device settings
device:
  default: auto                # Inherited from base models
  mixed_precision: false       # Inherited from base models
