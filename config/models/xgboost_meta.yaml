# XGBoost Meta-Learner Configuration
# For use as meta-learner in stacking ensembles
# Gradient boosting meta-learner for learning complex prediction combinations

# Model identification
model:
  name: xgboost_meta
  family: meta_learner
  description: XGBoost gradient boosting meta-learner for stacking ensembles

# Default hyperparameters
defaults:
  # Tree parameters
  n_estimators: 100          # Number of boosting rounds
  max_depth: 3               # Shallow trees to prevent overfitting on OOF predictions

  # Learning
  learning_rate: 0.1         # Step size shrinkage

  # Sampling
  subsample: 0.8             # Row subsampling ratio
  colsample_bytree: 0.8      # Column subsampling ratio

  # Early stopping
  early_stopping_rounds: 10  # Early stopping patience

# Training settings
training:
  random_seed: 42

# Note: Meta-learners receive 2D OOF predictions (n_samples, n_base_models * n_classes)
