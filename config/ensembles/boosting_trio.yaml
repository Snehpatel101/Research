# Boosting Trio Ensemble Configuration
# Fast baseline ensemble combining three gradient boosting models

ensemble:
  name: boosting_trio
  method: voting  # voting, stacking, or blending
  description: Fast ensemble of XGBoost + LightGBM + CatBoost

# Base models (all must be tabular models - 2D input)
base_models:
  - xgboost
  - lightgbm
  - catboost

# Voting configuration
voting:
  # Weights for each base model (null = equal weights)
  weights: null  # [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

  # Voting strategy
  strategy: soft  # soft (probability averaging) or hard (majority vote)

# Training settings
